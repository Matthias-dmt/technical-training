# 🧠 Exercise — Realistic Interview Version

You are given a list of values.

Return the value that occurs most frequently.

Assume:

• The list may contain positive or negative integers.
• The list may be large.
• The list may be empty.

You are not allowed to use nested iteration over the full list.

If multiple values share the highest frequency, the function may return any one of them.

If the input is empty, decide what behavior makes sense and explain it.

What I Expect From You

Before writing code:

1. Ask clarification questions (as if I’m the interviewer).
2. State assumptions.
3. Describe approach.
4. Then implement.
5. Then give time + space complexity.
