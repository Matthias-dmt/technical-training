# Technical Training

This repository contains my ongoing technical training focused on:

- Algorithms & data structures
- Backend engineering challenges
- System design fundamentals

The goal is not only to solve problems, but to improve clarity, structure, and reasoning under constraints.

---

## Methodology

For each exercise:

1. Rewrite the specification clearly
2. Identify edge cases
3. Define approach and complexity
4. Implement clean, readable solution
5. Add automated tests
6. Document trade-offs and possible improvements

---

## Structure

- `algorithms/` → classic coding challenges (Codility / LeetCode style)
- `backend-challenges/` → real-world backend scenarios (rate limiting, queues, idempotency, etc.)
- `system-design/` → architecture thinking and scalable system patterns

---

## Why this repository?

As a senior engineer, I believe deliberate practice matters.

This repository is a way to:

- Maintain algorithmic sharpness
- Strengthen system-level thinking
- Improve structured problem-solving

All exercises are written in TypeScript and tested using Vitest.
